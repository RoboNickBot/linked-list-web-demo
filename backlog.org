Some features I intend to implement: 

(this is an Emacs Org-Mode notes file; I'm sorry if GitHub renders it
weirdly)

* Improve randomInput function
  Empty cells tend to bunch up at the end

* Highlight cell-drawing relationships
  On mouse-over of boxes and arrows in the drawn list, they and the
  cell in the memory-edit area that they represent should highlight in
  some way as a quick indication of their relationship

* Improve sizing and centering of drawing area
** Properly center the drawn lists in the drawing area
** Get rid of that white-space at the bottom of the screen
   (while making sure not to make a scroll-bar appear)
** Make the drawing auto-resize whenever the window-size changes

* General re-factoring
  Particularly in JS.hs, it's kind of a mess in there
