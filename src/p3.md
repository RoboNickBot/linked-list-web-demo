# JavaScript as a Compiler Target

Actually quite a few projects

Looked to **Haskell** as language-of-choice

Several options, including [**Fay**](https://github.com/faylang/fay/wiki)
and [**GHCJS**](https://github.com/ghcjs/ghcjs)

There's also [**Elm**](http://elm-lang.org)

Elm is a descendant of Haskell, **not quite as powerful**

Able to compile to full **HTML5+CSS+JavaScript** webpages, handling browser
compatibility issues and concurrent user interactions
